# Page Scraper
Create an application which connects to a site and pulls out all links, or images, and saves them to a list. Optional: Organize the indexed content and donâ€™t allow duplicates. Have it put the results into an easily searchable index file.

*** Note: 2 versions: one with regex, and the other with BeautifulSoup Library.
